## The problem of evil and suffering 

The problem of suffering can rationally justify the argument for the validity of atheism if we base this on the existence of evil. **If God exists, then why does God allow people or animals to suffer?** Although not all atheists may think this way, it seems to be a popular claim enough for theists to have created a [whole field of discourse to philosophize this problem further](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_responses_to_the_problem_of_evil). We take, for example, what we call “unfriendly atheism,” which believes that [“no one is rationally justified in believing that the theistic God exists.”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20009775) This atheistic identity stems from the premise that God is an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.

Simply put, God is all knowing, God is all powerful, and God, alongside being all knowing and all powerful, is all good will. If such premises are correct, then [God can prevent suffering unless God could not do so without sacrificing a greater good](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20009775). However, if God could not prevent suffering under these conditions where there is no need to sacrifice the greater good, then God may not be omnipotent since omnipotence relies on the ability to do everything.

On the other hand, God may be omnipotent and omniscient, yet God may not be innately good. This claim would make sense. If God is not good, then God does not need to stop evil from occurring in the world.

As Epicurus and Hume would put it:
```
P1. If an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient god exists, then evil does not.

P2. There is evil in the world.

C1. Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient god does not exists.
```

A theist might reject this argument for the validity of an unfriendly atheist’s beliefs by claiming that suffering might eventually produce a more significant benefit, which I can only describe as [toxic positivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_positivity). In this frame of reference, we believe that suffering is a necessary step in achieving a higher degree of moral and spiritual development. However, it is also clear that [suffering may sometimes feel unnecessarily too cruel](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20009775), kind of like [what the Buddhists believe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%E1%B8%A5kha).

From a theistic point of view, the discourse which calls into question the existence of suffering in a world made by an almighty God filled with goodness is called [‘theodicy.’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodicy)

## Experiencing suffering

The idea of theodicy involves an understanding of suffering, given that God exists, God is good, and God follows some standard of ethics. There are different versions of theodicy across various religions, but for this purposes, we will focus on the Christian response to the problem of suffering. There are also other arguments towards the same problem outside theistic religions. One such example is [cosmodicy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cosmodicy), which refers to the discourse involving the understanding of suffering given that nature is good. Another parallel is [anthropodicy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1463312), which seeks to unite the goodness of humanity to the existence of evil, especially those which are human-made.

In the discussion of theodicy, we define suffering as a psycho-emotional response to the violation of our own will or our nature as individuals. To even experience suffering, we should understand that it is essential to know the opposite of suffering.

If my goal every day is to eat lunch at noon, then my body will get used to this routine. Hence, if I violate this goal by delaying my lunchtime or not eating at all, my body will initiate a counter-response that I could identify as suffering. This response is hunger.

The same is true even if I have never experienced the benefits of my goal. For example, if I have never tasted baked sushi in my entire life, but I have heard of the experience of tasting baked sushi from someone else, then I can develop a desire to eat baked sushi for lunch. This desire might be met with some sort of disappointment if I learn that the store is closed or the baked sushi is out of stock. However, this disappointment only exists because I know of the experience of eating baked sushi.

## Suffering as a step towards flourishing

In inquiring about God’s existence, Thomas Aquinas wrote, in his thesis entitled Summa Theologia, that Augustine once said: [“Since God is the highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil.”](https://www.logoslibrary.org/augustine/enchiridion/011.html) Aquinas suggested that [“this is part of the infinite goodness of God, that He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good.”](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3)

The presence of these [binary oppositions, or conflicting forces in the narrative of theodicy](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9781315727868-3/narrative-structures-bronwen-thomas) also presents our place in life in contrast to the idea of the afterlife. Here, the fight between good versus evil comes into play. In our example about the baked sushi, we know that I can only experience suffering when I know how non-suffering exists. For Aquinas, claiming the understanding of suffering within our lives is strange without the notion of the afterlife. To him, [the benefits of suffering may outweigh the loss in the afterlife—where everlasting flourishing is possible and will of God converges with our desire](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199277421.003.0014). Nonetheless, this acceptance of suffering requires that the sufferer or the person in pain must be willing to experience the suffering in the first place. Since we define suffering as a response to the violation of our desire, then it is a perplexing idea to propose that we must give up our desire in order to experience a more significant gain after risking ourselves in the face of a loss.

Aquinas’s strategy in resolving the paradox of theodicy is by proposing that [“people should focus their care only on their flourishing, their ultimate, spiritual flourishing.”](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199277421.003.0014) Here, the concept of the stern-minded attitude is made present. To achieve this ultimate flourishing in the stern-minded worldview, then people are asked to let go of their desires and make room for the path which God made for us. In a Christian sense, the impression of a stern-minded attitude revolves around the idea of following the will of God, according to the scriptures of the Christian doctrines. This sacrifice is done in exchange for an immortal life in heaven, and often, salvation from the fires of hell. After all, what is a lifetime of suffering compared to an eternity in hell?

However, following God’s desire requires us to know what God’s desire is in the first place. Usually, religions have traditions and texts which dictate practices that solidifies the ethics of God. Since every religion has a different idea of God, then this ethics of God is realistically not standardized. Even so, let us recall that in theodicy, we should expect a standard of ethics from God. There should be a metric by which God decides a will or a desire to communicate to humanity.

In Hinduism, holy men called the [Aghoris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aghori) choose to live with the dead. In addition, they accessorize themselves with human bones. To an outsider, this may seem odd. Some might label it as witchcraft or evil. Nevertheless, the existence of this type of belief and interaction proves the diversity of ethics in the world. To an Aghori, these practices involving the dead is ordinary and sacred since it brings them closer to Shiva whose creations are perfect.

The problem does not end here. Even if we knew what God’s desire is. It is still baffling why he would allow evil and suffering to exist. In the same document, Thomas Aquinas introduced the [Five Ways to prove the existence of God](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3). The first way claims that God is the first mover—the unmoved mover. It follows that nothing can be in motion if nothing was ever in motion in the first place. The unmoved mover is the being that set the universe in motion. Hence, the unmoved mover is the catalyst to the transformation of all potentialities into actualities, which then becomes potentialities to a different actuality, which is moved by the ripples of the first mover’s motion. Therefore, if God exists and everything that happens to our surroundings occurs through the will of God, then does that mean that suffering occurs when our will does not agree to God’s will?

Aquinas would say yes. Ultimately, suffering is defined to be an experience of loss in terms of the desires of the heart. In his theodicy, Aquinas proposes that [“there is a connection between other desires of the heart and the innate deepest heart’s desire for God and shared union with God.”](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199277421.003.0014)

### Suffering is the will of a benevolent God

[Elenore Stump argues that Aquinas’s response is problematic in two ways.](https://cct.biola.edu/limits-theodicy-eleonore-stump/) She claims that this theodicy is self-defeating such that it is counterintuitive to present a solution to suffering, which involves suffering as well. Secondly, she claims that Aquinas’s position is difficult to comprehend such that it relies on compartmentalizing suffering into an earthly struggle that could flourish in the afterlife. However, seeing that humans do not have the full ability to comprehend the afterlife, then some people might not even care about this eventual flourishing in comparison to the certain possibility of suffering, which they feel and understand right now.

On the other hand, we may argue that if God truly is the first mover, then his permission for the occurrence of suffering may be more active than we thought. We go back to our third assumption, which is that God is good. Given that suffering may occur to derive a better benefit for humanity, then the desires of God may include suffering. Given these premises, which we are assuming to be true, can we conclude that the root of suffering is the disagreement between the desires of our hearts and the desires of God?

To answer this question, we assume that the will of God can only bring what is good as how it should fit in the question of theodicy, and that the desires of man will sometimes disagree with the will of God. Therefore, suffering stems from disagreements between the desires of the heart and the desires of God, as previously mentioned.

However, focusing on the assumption that God is the first mover and everything that has happened has occurred due to God’s desires, then that means that everything that happens, including the things that I do, is because of the desire of God. Since we are saying that God caused everything, then that means that when man disagrees with the will of God, then it is also due to the will of God.

Simply put, if suffering exists because God allowed it to be a source of motivation for our moral and spiritual development, and suffering occurs when we disagree with God, then our mere disagreement with God may be caused by God as well. Therefore, suffering does not come from the disagreement of the desires of the heart to the desires of God. Suffering may come from the desires of God himself.

It is reasonable for one to say that the conclusion in the argument is unsound because it goes against the premise that God is good. However, it is hasty to conclude anything about the goodness of God for now, because we do not know yet if good necessarily means the absence of suffering. Good might not be at odds with suffering. What contrasts with good is evil, and there is no proof that suffering is evil.

Looking back, we see that it is difficult to share a union with God just by choosing good when sometimes what is objectively good may not be ethically appropriate. That is true even for the problem of suffering. Do we cause our suffering, or is God responsible for our suffering since it is God who can move anything in the universe? The question moves from “Why does God allow suffering?” to “Why does God allow us to believe that suffering is a horrible experience if God’s goal is to give us a better sense of self through suffering?”
