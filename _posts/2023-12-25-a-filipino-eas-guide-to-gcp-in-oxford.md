### What is GCP?

The Global Challenges Project (GCP) conducts intensive 3-day workshops for students, focusing on existential risk reduction, especially in the fields of AI and bio-risk. These workshops are primarily intended for students who are looking to concretize their next steps after participating.

To me, its main selling points are the networking opportunities, career guidance, and learning experiences. The conversations I had over those three days were incredibly valuable. Therefore, I would encourage anyone who has the opportunity to join this workshop to make the most of it. Book as many 1:1s as you can. Don't hesitate to initiate discussions, critically evaluate arguments, and maintain a [scout mindset](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/scout-mindset) in such an environment.

It’s important to note that GCP operates under the assumption that there is a 1 in 6 chance of an existential catastrophe occurring within the next 80 years. This assumption forms the basis of the workshop lectures. If you don't completely agree with this viewpoint, that's perfectly fine. It's a topic open for questioning and further evaluation.

For more information about their workshops, you can check out the [Global Challenges Project](https://www.globalchallengesproject.org/).

#### Who can apply and who has applied?

Students, both undergraduate and graduate, from anywhere in the world are welcome to apply. Note that [travel support is offered](https://globalchallengesproject.notion.site/Our-travel-support-policy-c330d566544943d29f4fcc7962bf3106) for Filipinos attending the Oxford workshop. Although travel support is not given automatically every time you request. This is further evaluated by the organizers. As of this writing, the following Filipinos have attended the workshop:

1. Lexley Villasis, January 2023 (Oxford, UK)
2. Kriz Tahimic, February 2023 (Berkeley, USA)
3. Neil Limbaga, June 2023 (Berkeley, USA)
4. Immanuel Aquino, July 2023 (Oxford, UK)
5. Dani Castillo, July 2023 (Oxford, UK)
6. Renzo de Guzman, July 2023 (Oxford, UK)
7. Lenz Dagohoy, December 2023 (Oxford, UK) (← it me)
8. Rozenne Sola, December 2023 (Oxford, UK)

#### How much should you know about x-risks before attending?

Participants are expected to have at least a basic understanding of what existential risks are and to have read some introductory materials on the topic. In my cohort, there were individuals who were quite new to x-risks and effective altruism (EA) at the time of the workshop, indicating that you don't need to be an expert to attend. Additionally, GCP provides pre-work materials that you will receive upon acceptance.

### Any advice for applying?

GCP has developed [a comprehensive Notion page with advice for applying to their workshops](https://resources.globalchallengesproject.org/), which I highly recommend checking out.

The application process involves completing an online form and participating in an interview. Interested students should submit the application form, detailing their engagement with materials related to effective altruism (EA) and existential risks (x-risks). The organizers review these submissions for their suitability for the workshop. Shortlisted candidates will then be invited for a brief interview to assess their understanding of x-risks and their potential for contributing to meaningful discussions.

I strongly advise applying when you find yourself at a point in your learning journey where you encounter confusions about the materials that could be addressed in the workshop context. This is also advisable if you're at a stage in your career where you're eager to take concrete steps towards addressing x-risks but are uncertain about where to start. Clearly articulating your motivations and intentions during the interview is crucial. It not only increases your chances of acceptance but also ensures a more rewarding and purposeful experience if you are accepted.

In my case, I applied to the GCP with a specific intention: to explore the role of the Global South in advancing the field of AI safety. During the interview, I made sure to substantiate this 'why' – explaining my motivation and the importance of this topic. I focused on this goal throughout the workshop, and this involved identifying the right people to talk to and knowing the most relevant questions to ask, as well as the key topics to discuss. This intentionality helped me make the most of the workshop experience.

### I got in. What's next?

I assume you are reading this because you are planning to attend the Oxford workshop. I don’t know much about the Boston and Berkeley workshops but you can contact a past GCP participant who has attended those for insights on their experiences and advice.

Regarding the UK visa application, note that the visa validity is 6 months. This means you can apply up to 5 months before your workshop date. While it's possible to complete the process within a month, I recommend starting at least 2 months in advance to organize all your paperwork. Applying only a month before, or even less as in my case, can be very risky. I was fortunate to secure a cheaper flight and had sufficient funds from my GCP travel support to opt for a priority visa service.

#### How do I apply for a visa?

Applying for a UK visa can be a complex and daunting process, particularly when you're navigating it without the assistance of an agency. As I went through the visa application process independently, without hiring an agency, I'm unable to recommend any specific one. However, [I'm happy to detail the steps I followed to successfully apply for a UK visa on my own](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p7bUWVqG94FZDROXUcrBpkwD6N6LbfWPf4pnIQvdlVs/edit#heading=h.tt6m33jnu0ym). [This page has everything about getting a UK visa as a standard visitor.](https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor)

#### What should I prepare before I leave?

If you could pre-plan and pre-book a lot of what you want to do during your trip, then great! That saves you a lot of trouble and money, especially in the UK where everything seems to be really expensive, at least considering a student’s budget. But at the very least, pre-book and pre-pay for the following:

1. **Flight tickets**
	
	The earlier you book, the cheaper it is. But some of you will get accepted probably a month or two before your supposed trip so here are some places to get cheaper-than-usual flight tickets:
	- [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights)  
	- [CheapFlights](https://www.cheapflights.com.ph)
	A lot of airlines actually have student club memberships with really cool perks or student discounts.[^1] You can check some of the perks here:

| Airline | Special fare | Baggage allowance | Booking change | Companion pass | Onboard wifi |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [Qatar Airways](https://www.qatarairways.com/en/Privilege-Club/student-club-join-now.html) (until graduation) | 10% off on 1st booking and 15% off on 2nd booking | +10kg or +1 more piece depending on route | 1 date change for you and companions | Share benefits with family members or friends | Free hour of wifi per flight |

2. **Accommodations**
	
	Booking an AirBnB is generally a cheaper option than a hotel. However, most AirBnBs in the UK are shared. A lot of doors also don’t have locks. If that’s not something you’re comfortable with, I would advise spending a bit more on a hotel if you have the budget so you can have the flexibility to just leave your luggage without dealing with so many house rules.
	
	If you plan to go around Oxford, I would suggest to come earlier a few days before the workshop so you can also use the time to adjust to the jetlag. If not, that’s also fine. Oxford is beautiful, but I think you can go around Oxford within a day especially if you don’t plan to get tours which cost a few pounds per building. [Check out this blog to have some more ideas of what to do in Oxford.](https://www.wheregoesrose.com/oxford-day-trip/) For accommodations, I’d actually recommend spending at least a night within Oxford city center or even just within its outskirts since the vibe is really different compared to London.
	- [You can stay in one of the empty uni rooms that students rent out.](https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/) Just make sure to check the reviews since I can’t guarantee you that all of this is legit, but most of this is at least. If you’re a big Harry Potter nerd, try staying at Christ Church and try getting a room with breakfast inclusions so you could dine at the Great Hall.
	- [You can also try booking an AirBnb around Eynsham, Witney, or even Oxford City Centre itself.](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Oxford--United-Kingdom/homes?tab_id=home_tab&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&flexible_trip_lengths%5B%5D=one_week&monthly_start_date=2024-01-01&monthly_length=3&price_filter_input_type=2&channel=EXPLORE&query=Oxford%2C%20United%20Kingdom&place_id=ChIJrx_ErYAzcUgRAnRUy6jbIMg&date_picker_type=calendar&source=structured_search_input_header&search_type=filter_change&price_filter_num_nights=5&adults=1&guest_favorite=true) The bus fare to Oxford City Centre is GBP 2.00 per ride if you buy the tickets online or on paper. It’s around GBP 1.40 if you use contactless payment. An unlimited 1-day ticket is probably around GBP 4.25. I’m not so sure about the prices since I mostly used a single trip ticket to and from Eynsham Church, then contactless going around Oxford, but you can [check the bus provider for more details](https://www.stagecoachbus.com/tickets/all-tickets).
	- [You can also book hotels around the area if you have a bit more money](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hotels/@51.7535502,-1.3497704,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m19!2m18!3m5!2sOxford!3s0x4876c6a2790faf05:0xba97a9d53201a3c!4m2!1d-1.2699454!2d51.7534694!5m10!3e2!4e2!5m5!1s2024-03-20!2i2!4m1!1i1!5b1!9i6989!13e6!6e3?entry=ttu), though I’d recommend booking hotels in London instead since Oxford is a bit more high-trust.
	If you plan to go around London, I would definitely recommend [some cheap hotels](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hotels/@51.5077929,-0.1737216,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!2m13!5m11!3e2!3e3!3e4!4e2!5m4!1s2024-03-25!2i2!4m1!1i2!9i7017!13e6!6e3?entry=ttu) instead. [There are AirBnBs but they’re also a bit pricey so might as well spend a few more pounds for comfort.](https://www.airbnb.com/s/London--United-Kingdom/homes?tab_id=home_tab&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&flexible_trip_lengths%5B%5D=one_week&monthly_start_date=2024-01-01&monthly_length=3&price_filter_input_type=2&channel=EXPLORE&query=London%2C%20United%20Kingdom&place_id=ChIJdd4hrwug2EcRmSrV3Vo6llI&date_picker_type=calendar&adults=1&source=structured_search_input_header&search_type=autocomplete_click) Just make sure to check the reviews even for hotels just in case of bed bugs or some other deal breaker scenarios. I stayed in a [Holiday Inn Express in Park Royal](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/london/lonah/hoteldetail) and the experience was pretty okay. They had a breakfast inclusion, which is not common in UK hotels. The only downside was the nearest train station doesn’t have lifts. Also if your flight is in the afternoon, figure out if your hotel or AirBnb can accommodate a late checkout without a fee. It would be so great to go around without carrying any luggage around.

3. **Travel insurance**
	
	This is completely optional, but it’s a good-to-have if your airplane ticket doesn’t cover it. You can get cheap travel insurance from [AXA](https://www.axa.com.ph/products/travel-insurance) or even [VFS Global](https://www.vfsglobal.com/en/individuals/travel-insurance.html).

#### How can I get around in the UK?

Getting from one place to another in the UK is pretty easy compared to the Philippines. If you’re traveling alone, then Google Maps is your friend. The most important thing you need to know is how to get from London to Oxford, and the answer is:
* You can take the train, though it’s a bit pricier. There’s a direct train to Oxford via GWR from any of the main London terminals like Paddington or Reading. At peak, it can cost around GBP 34.00, and it may be better to book. Note that they have a real paper ticket. It’s not contactless. You can also reserve a train via 3rd party apps like Trainline for cheaper.
* You can also take the bus, which is around GBP 10.00 cheaper. Both National Express and Megabus have a London to Oxford bus. I’m not sure where exactly it is, but I’m sure you can find it through Google Maps.

Aside from that, you can figure out most of it with Google Maps. Just remember, everything in Oxford is walkable, but if you’re tired and want to catch a ride, Oxford is primarily a bus city. London, on the other hand, is full of buses and trains. You can get around pretty quickly.

Note that the UK is pretty cashless. I’d suggest to probably exchange max GBP 100.00 just in case of emergencies, and probably just bring some USD.

#### How many days should I stay and where should I go?

I’d suggest allotting time to recover from jetlag and to prepare your body for a 20+ hour flight before coming home.

For going around Oxford, I reckon you can finish within a day or two unless you want to vibe like a student and try entering libraries and coworking in it. Some cool sights to see (note that entering a lot of these buildings requires you to pay a fee):
- Radcliffe Camera and Radcliffe Square
- University Church of St. Mary the Virgin
- The Divinity School
- Sheldonian Theatre
- Bridge of Sighs
- Christ Church College
- Balliol College
- Magdalen College
- Weston Library
- Pitt Rivers Museum
- Oxford University Museum of Natural History
- The Ashmolean
- Covered Market

There are also places to leave your luggage in restaurants near the train station, although for a fee. For graphic novel nerds, Blackwell’s Bookshop has such a vibe. For physics and engineering nerds, try eating at wagamama.

For going around London, each museum probably takes 4 hours to finish if you’re a nerd. Take note to book in advance to skip the queues. Though aside from the usuals like Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, and the London Eye, here are some cool museums you might wanna take a look at:
- The National Gallery, London
- The British Museum
- Science Museum
- Natural Museum of History
- Victoria and Albert Museum

Happy hour in Soho is also pretty fun. Walking down Regent St. and Carnaby St. is genuinely a whole vibe. Of course, for theatre kids, booking a show at West End (via TodayTix for cheaper prices) is so worth it.

If you have a bit more time, the closest day trip you could probably do is going to Stonehenge. Although it’s around a 3-4 hour travel time.

If you’re feeling super career-driven, feel free to reach out to other UK-based EAs and have a quick chat. I did this during my stay and it was a pretty cool experience grabbing a drink or two with people you’ve always wanted to have a 1:1 with. You also get free recommendations on where to go, or a free tour guide if they’re willing.
