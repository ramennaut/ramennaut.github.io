# Hi, I'm Lenz. I'm a social technologist.

You may know me as `ramennaut` in a lot of platforms. In real life, people just call me Lenz.

I'm like a classically-trained pop star -- except instead of classical music, I underwent rigorous training doing academic research, and instead of being a pop star, I'm now essentially a product developer.

I have my roots in research and I love it so much that I'm probably never going to let it go. But I have also developed a deep hyperfixation for building socially-attuned technologies that contributes a net positive impact to the world. I'm a social technologist who cares about ethical AI, the digital divide, governance of emerging tech, and designing for neurodiversity.

This space is for my *very public* brain dump since microblogs donâ€™t seem to do the trick anymore. A lot of the things I wrote and dumped here may not make sense. Please take note that unless I specifically shared it to you or publicly posted it on social media, I probably just wrote it for myself, following my *own* train of thought.

If you find yourself interested in [the same things I care about](/now), feel free to [drop me a message](mailto:mail@lenz.wiki).
