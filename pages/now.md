## What's keeping me busy

- **Studying.** I'm on my penultimate year of undergraduate studies, pursuing a [humanities-focused program](https://www.ateneo.edu/soh/is/academics/ab-is), majoring in socio-anthropology and computer science, and with a minor in humanitarian action.
- **Writing.** My junior thesis on grassroots fundraising for digitally disavantaged communities recently got nominated for the [ASCEND Awards](https://www.ateneo.edu/document/memorandum/2024/03/13/call-nominations-ateneo-socio-civic-engagement-national-development), a research award for studdies that promotes socio-civic engagement for national development.
- **Learning.** I'm about to finish Bluedot Impact's course on [AI Alignment](https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment-2023) and [AI Governance](https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/governance-2023), which I did at the same time (I'm not sure why). I'm currently building my project.
- **Launching.** Outside of academics and personal upskilling, my team and I are finally launching [Condor Global Southeast Asia](https://global.condorinitiative.org/), an AI safety camp to accelerate the careers of talented Southeast Asian students in AI safety.
- **Innovating.** I'm also building [Patch](https://projectpatch.co/), a smart marketplace that helps simplify and secure online thrifting. We are currently incubated by [Arete Sandbox](https://arete.ateneo.edu/programs/patch-engaging-communities-in-circular-fashion-through-tech-driven-interventions) and [Ateneo Blue Nest](https://www.aipo.ateneo.edu/bluenest). **Perhaps thrifters and artisan-followers might find it interesting enough to waitlist on our website.**
- **Working.** I started work a few weeks ago as a Business Development Specialist in [a university-based startup incubator](https://www.aipo.ateneo.edu/bluenest).
- **Coding.** I built a game for my CS final, and I've been thinking of posting it here, but I'm still a bit shy. Maybe in a few weeks.

## What I'm obsessed about

- Recently, I've been talking about and reading up a lot on global catastrophic risks, more specifically AI risk.
- I've been very interested in the relationship of food and the human body, as well as the culture surrounding it in different communities. I've been thinking about reducing my meat consumption, but it's still an ongoing process. Right now, I'm trying to get comfortable with intermittent fasting since I feel like I need to be okay first with the idea of less food in my body before I completely switch too plant-based, given my tendency to mindlessly overeat.
- Improving institutional decision-making and the innovation infrastructure in low-middle income countries has been something I've been thinking about for years but I'm almost clueless on what to do with it. I'd love to have conversations on this!
