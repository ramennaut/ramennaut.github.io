## What's keeping me busy

- I'm on my penultimate year of undergraduate studies, pursuing a [humanities-focused program](https://www.ateneo.edu/soh/is/academics/ab-is), with majors in socio-anthropology and computer science, and a minor in humanitarian action. I've started writing my junior thesis on conditional cash transfer schemes.
- I spend some chunk of my time every week learning more about AI safety. These days, I'm working with some friends from the University of Philippines to build communities and programs for AI safety field-building in the Philippines.
- I'm looking more into the Filipino circular fashion economy and how certain cultural caveats affect our behaviors around it. I work on this as a co-founder of Patch and the Community Engagement Head of [Fashion Revolution Philippines](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/asia/philippines/).
- I've been learning how to code proper website (I mean "proper" as outside of HTML/CSS).

## What I'm obsessed about

- I think a lot about how to improve my productivity in the most humane (by that, I mean neurodiverse-inclusive lol) way possible.
- Recently, I've been talking about and reading up a lot on global catastrophic risks, more specifically AI risk.
- I've been very interested in the relationship of food and the human body, as well as the culture surrounding it in different communities. I've been thinking about reducing my meat consumption, but it's still an ongoing process. Right now, I'm trying to get comfortable with intermittent fasting since I feel like I need to be okay first with the idea of less food in my body before I completely switch too plant-based, given my tendency to mindlessly overeat.
- Improving institutional decision-making and the innovation infrastructure in low-middle income countries has been something I've been thinking about for years but I'm almost clueless on what to do with it. I'd love to have conversations on this!
