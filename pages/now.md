## What's keeping me busy

- **Studying.** I'm on my final year of undergraduate studies, pursuing a [humanities-focused program](https://www.ateneo.edu/soh/is/academics/ab-is), majoring in socio-anthropology and computer science, and with a minor in humanitarian action.
- **Writing.** My senior thesis is on mapping the urban food deserts in Metro Manila. My food hyperfixation led me to a rabbithole and here I am.
- **Learning.** I'm relearning AI/ML and recently joined [Whitebox Research's](https://www.facebook.com/WhiteBoxResearch) AI safety reading group.
- **Field-building.** I'm organizing a Condor Camp iteration in Southeast Asia along with a few cool people. I'll maybe post an update on it soon.
- **Working.** I still work part-time at my uni's startup incubator.

## What I'm obsessed about

- Recently, I've been talking about and reading up a lot on global catastrophic risks, more specifically AI risk.
- I've been very interested in the relationship of food and the human body, as well as the culture surrounding it in different communities. I've been thinking about reducing my meat consumption, but it's still an ongoing process. Right now, I'm trying to get comfortable with intermittent fasting since I feel like I need to be okay first with the idea of less food in my body before I completely switch too plant-based, given my tendency to mindlessly overeat.
- Improving institutional decision-making and the innovation infrastructure in low-middle income countries has been something I've been thinking about for years but I'm almost clueless on what to do with it. I'd love to have conversations on this!
- I just learned about progress studies a few weeks ago. I'm trying to read up on it.
